# LBX Helper: Privacy Policy

LBX Helper is an open-source mobile application developed by Scott Kruger. The source code is
available on GitHub under the MIT license, and the application is distributed on the Google Play and
Apple App stores.

This application does not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information, or indeed
any information at all besides application preferences, which are only stored locally on the device
and can be removed by deleting the app data.

In the event of a security vulnerability in my code or a third-party library included therein,
or for any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact me via email.

Thanks,
